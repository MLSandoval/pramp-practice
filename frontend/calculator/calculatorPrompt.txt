Build a web calculator, that supports the basic operations of add, remove, multiply and divide.

In addition, support resetting the current state, as well as a decimal point button.

When you feel ready, you can validate your solution using any collaborative HTML/CSS renderer, such as this one.

Hints & Tips
Make sure your peers focuses first on functionality and layout, then optionally if time permits, on visual design
To make the best use of the time, suggest they first implement “add” end-to-end using HTML elements, and then expand
Suggest that your peer first try to think of ways the user might “break” the calculator, to not allow invalid inputs, e.g. 
“what happens if I click a number when the last digit is already a number? what about operations?”

Solution

Here’s a working web calculator for reference.

A few points to notice:

numbers and operators are (for the most part) ignored if invalid given the current state of the input
the logic for applying an operator is reused across all operators, except for the actual function to execute
the order in which the operators are defined is also the order in which they’ll be executed, which makes it significant
the styling mimics a common calculator design, yet even without it the calculator is fully functional
